+ task

Attendees: Coyle, Williams, Robinson

Synopsis:
---

* Robinson has been revising multimodel.pdf "Sheaf and cosheaf methods...".  Expect final version end of this week.  Beware! Many annoying errors found...
* Coyle and librarian completed literature search on use of Goodwin model and networked international trade beyond two countries
 - Finding: Apparently this has not been done at all
* Coyle and Williams: succeeded at sheafification of Goodwin model for one country with a closed economy

Action items
---

Robinson:
+ Circulate new version of "multimodel.pdf" incorporating many (embarrassing) corrections

Coyle/Williams:
+ Construct diagram for the Goodwin model of two countries
 - Scrape all variables
 - write dependency diagram
 - expand dependency diagram
 - Form state spaces diagram
 - Expectation: the original Goodwin model diagram will appear two times as subdiagrams, interlinked in some way.  What is that linkage?
+ (Next) What is missing from the linkage?
+ (Next) Generalize to more than two countries
