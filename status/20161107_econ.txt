Synopsis:
---

* Williams and Coyle successfully sheafafied the Goodwin model of two countries engaged in horizontal trade. The sheaf appears quite symmetric.
 - The diagram isn't quite a sheaf because the diagram doesn't commute, though it's easy enough to consider the largest subdiagram that is a sheaf.
 - No cohomology expected in degree 2 or higher 
 - From the large state space there is only one path to get to the four corner leaves.
  . This subspace only depends on p_1 and p_2 (prices) independently u_i, v_i (workers' profit shares and labor force participations) in the separate Goodwin models.

* Question: Let's say that we fix price 1. Can we say anything that is happening in country 1? I.e. can we backtrack and make inferences about back in time? If we have a local section at p_1, how far can we extend this section? To the state space? To u_1, v_1.
 - Does this allow us to inferences about whether the Goodwin model has broken down in country one?
 - Essentially asking about maximal local sections or approximate sections

* To extend the model pairwise to more countries, it's pretty simple â€“ just cut and paste. What about vertical trade?

Action items:
---

Coyle/Williams:
+ Attempt to extend the existing model to more than two countries
 - How might competition get expressed?  Realize that the sheaf model will at this point be underspecified, but will present a framework for such a model
 - Literature search: Identify a vertical trade paper to see if that helps to fill out the framework
+ Can we identify 2 countries and 2 products and get data? 
 - Potentially run this through PySheaf. (Dependent on Robinson (partially) completing a re-architecture exercise)

Coyle:
+ Coyle will contact the econ department to set up a time for us to chat.
