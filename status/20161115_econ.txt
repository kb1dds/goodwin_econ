Attendees: Coyle, Williams, Robinson

Synopsis:
---

* Williams and Coyle constructed a model of competitive trade of three countries
 - Countries 1 and 3 sell a common good to Country 2, who sells different products to Countries 1 and 3
 - Using Goodwin model in each country
 - Ishiyama model for trade between countries 1 and 2, and 2 and 3, but...
 - There's an additional competitive link between Countries 1 and 3, there's a common price

* Williams and Coyle construct a two country model of vertical trade and specified what a 3 country vertical trade model might look like
 - But we don't know if it's actually vertical trade because of concerns about feedback loops

* Question (for two country Ishiyama model): Let's say that we fix price 1. Can we say anything that is happening in country 1? I.e. can we backtrack and make inferences about back in time? If we have a local section at p_1, how far can we extend this section? To the state space? To u_1, v_1.
 - Does this allow us to inferences about whether the Goodwin model has broken down in country one?
 - Essentially asking about maximal local sections or approximate sections

Action items:
---

Coyle/Williams:
+ Compute equilibria for the competitive three country model
+ (on hold until Robinson finished pysheaf) Can we identify 2 countries and 2 products and get data? 

Coyle:
* Coyle contacted the econ department, but no answer yet... We have questions about
 - Realism of the models we've made thus far
 - Availability of data to test these models
 - Should vertical trade models include feedback or not?

Robinson:
+ Actually do the pysheaf trade space analysis as promised (for months now!)
+ (Low priority) How to systematically do bifurcation analysis on a parametrized sheaf model of an ODE system
 - Essentially, what do global sections of a (pre)sheaf of smooth manifolds look like?  Is there an easy way to examine them using, say, transversality?
 - Of course, a sheaf of smooth manifolds would need gluing axioms satisfied, which might not work out! We might need stratified manifolds throughout... hmm...
