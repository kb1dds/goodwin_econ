Attendees: Coyle, Fantie, Williams, Robinson

Note: Next meeting February 2

Synopsis:
---


Action items:
---

Coyle:
+ Answer questions about your document!
+ Find examples of local sections that don't extend -- explain the implications of this
 - Systematically examine the space of partial assignments to various elements in the poset 

Fantie:
+ Read Philip's document
+ Re-look at pysheaf
 - SheafCoface class is largely under construction in that .corestriction --> .restriction, these will probably end up being some Morphism class in themselves
 - Have a view towards implementing our sheaf models in pysheaf natively

Williams:
+ Write an abstract for the Student Research Conference (max 1000 characters)
 - Share a draft with the group for feedback
 - Final submission is due February 10
+ Read Philip's document
+ Read up on bifurcation analysis, read Strogatz's book on Dynamical systems
 - End goal is to understand whether Ishiyama's model goes through any interesting bifurcations when lags in wage responses are introduced

Fantie/Williams:
+ Can we identify 2 countries and 2 products and get data?
 - Possibly use bundles instead of 2 products as a proxy

Kraft:
+ Read Ishiyama paper

Robinson:
+ (In progress) Working through pysheaf trade space analysis
 - Aim to get consistency radius
+ (Low priority) How to systematically do bifurcation analysis on a parametrized sheaf model of an ODE system
 - Essentially, what do global sections of a (pre)sheaf of smooth manifolds look like?  Is there an easy way to examine them using, say, transversality?
 - Of course, a sheaf of smooth manifolds would need gluing axioms satisfied, which might not work out! We might need stratified manifolds throughout... hmm...
