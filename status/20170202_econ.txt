SIMPLEX notes for economic modeling

+ task

Attendees: Coyle, Fantie, Williams, Robinson

Note: Next meeting February 9, 11:30am (tentative; subject to rescheduling depending on PNNL visit to AU)

Synopsis:
---

* Talked about the details of local sections as automated hypothesis generation
* Talked about encodings of Goodwin/Ishiyama model as sheaves
 - In particular, we might want to implement the two-level poset version (as described in "Sheaf and duality methods...") instead of the collapsed version, because the diagram commutes automatically
* Talked about implementation details of sheaves in pysheaf
 - The assignment to a cell (ie. values of one of the variables) will be a vector (probably numpy array) of timeseries values.  This is NOT stored in a Sheaf instance, but rather in something else (like a Section instance or better an Assignment (yet to be written))
 - Identity maps present no problems
 - Derivatives are sparse, block diagonal matrices as one would get from numerical analysis
 - The other restriction maps should either be linearized (not preferable) or stored wholesale as lambda expressions (preferable, but relies on Dr. Robinson finishing pysheaf rearchitecture exercise)

Action items:
---

Coyle:
+ Answer questions about your document!
* Found that a phase transition appears to happen when 5 variables are specified in a local section -- then we can always uniquely extend to at least one other variable
+ Systematically list all local sections, then specify what uniques extensions are possible
 - Think of this list as being if-then clauses, with the local section being the "if" and the extension being the "then"
 - Each of these clauses then become testable scientific inferences that we can address using data!

Fantie:
* Finished reading Philip's document!
* Looked at pysheaf; basically ready to start!
* Thesis paperwork apparently done...
+ Remind Dr. Robinson to finish pysheaf rearchitecture!
+ Functional design of the pysheaf implementation of Goodwin model
 - (later Ishiyama model or others)
 - Class definitions called out, with cofaces/corestrictions defined
  . One place where there will be trouble is in defining restriction maps since they're not linear!
  . Option 1: Linearize!
  . Option 2: Harrass Robinson to finish his edits to pysheaf!
 - Data parser...
  . suggestion is to python pandas library
  . might need to use a python-based scraping library

Williams:
+ Write an abstract for the Student Research Conference (max 1000 characters)
 - Share a draft with the group for feedback
 - Final submission is due February 10
+ Read Philip's document
+ Read up on bifurcation analysis, read Strogatz's book on Dynamical systems
 - End goal is to understand whether Ishiyama's model goes through any interesting bifurcations when lags in wage responses are introduced

Fantie/Williams:
+ Can we identify 2 countries and 2 products and get data?
 - Possibly use bundles instead of 2 products as a proxy

Kraft:
+ Read Ishiyama paper

Robinson:
+ Look into how AU hires consultants...
+ (In progress) Working through pysheaf trade space analysis
 - Aim to get consistency radius
+ (Low priority) How to systematically do bifurcation analysis on a parametrized sheaf model of an ODE system
 - Essentially, what do global sections of a (pre)sheaf of smooth manifolds look like?  Is there an easy way to examine them using, say, transversality?
 - Of course, a sheaf of smooth manifolds would need gluing axioms satisfied, which might not work out! We might need stratified manifolds throughout... hmm...
