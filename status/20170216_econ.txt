+ task

Attendees: Coyle, Fantie, Williams, Robinson

Note: Next meeting February 23, 11:30am

Synopsis:
---

* PySheaf update finally pushed to GitHub!
* Talked about encoding the models in pysheaf
 - Let's focus on the Goodwin model first
 - Then do the extended Goodwin model
 - Look at pysheaf/tests/search_rescue_test.py for how to structure the code
* Getting data for the (extended) Goodwin model
 - It looks like timeseries for u and v are going to be available
 - There are 5 constants that need to be estimated
  . 2 of them are straightforward to get via a regression using linearized Philips curve
  . the other 3 probably can be estimated but will likely be timeseries in their own right...  Does this impact the dynamics?
 - Pricing is going to be tricky since most countries don't have a single trading partner
  . US and Canada might be the best option, though it's far from perfect
* We'll reconnect with Prof. Kraft once we have data in hand and constants all estimated
 - That way we can get a "blessing" that we're on the right path

Action items:
---

Coyle:
+ Working through parameter estimation for Goodwin model's constants

Fantie:
* Finished reading Philip's document!
* Working through understanding how to encode sheaves in PySheaf...
+ Encode the Goodwin model in PySheaf, and then the extended Goodwin model
+ (Next) Data parser...
 . suggestion is to python pandas library
 . might need to use a python-based scraping library

Williams:
+ Read up on bifurcation analysis, read Strogatz's book on Dynamical systems
 - End goal is to understand whether Ishiyama's model goes through any interesting bifurcations when lags in wage responses are introduced
+ Working through parameter estimation for Goodwin model's constants

Coyle/Williams:
+ Can we identify 2 countries and 2 products and get data?
 - Possibly use bundles instead of 2 products as a proxy

Kraft:
+ Read Ishiyama paper
+ We'll aim to reconnect soon, essentially after Coyle/Williams finish parameter estimation

Robinson:
+ Still looking into how AU hires consultants... grr.
* PySheaf update is now completed!
+ (Low priority) How to systematically do bifurcation analysis on a parametrized sheaf model of an ODE system
 - Essentially, what do global sections of a (pre)sheaf of smooth manifolds look like?  Is there an easy way to examine them using, say, transversality?
 - Of course, a sheaf of smooth manifolds would need gluing axioms satisfied, which might not work out! We might need stratified manifolds throughout... hmm...
