Attendees: Coyle, Fantie, Williams, Robinson

Note: Next meeting ... at the SIMPLEX PI meeting next week.  Robinson speaks 9:50am on Wednesday, 1 March

Synopsis:
---

* Reformulated the Goodwin model so that it can support time-varying alpha, beta (time-varying sigma doesn't seem to impact the structure of the equations)

* Looks like the Phillips curve isn't working correctly
 - We can recover scatter plots for inflation versus employment rate and wage rate verus inflation.  Both plots match what others have done, so we're mostly confident of them.
 - The composition of the two, though, wage rate versus employment rate, seems to not yield a strong correlation!
 - Need to call in Dr. Kraft's help!

* PySheaf implementation of Goodwin models underway
 - The structure is correct and complete
 - The definition of the restriction maps needs a little help...  Should define LinearMorphism( NUMPY ARRAY ), though
 - A few more attributes for the cells need to be defined, but can be done easily
   . SheafCell.stalkDim = sum of lengths of the timeseries at that cell
   . SheafCell.compactClosure = True (unless told otherwise by Dr. Robinson)
   . SheafCell.metric = accept the default (Euclidean) but there is probably a more generally accepted metric that we ought to use...
 - We talked about "closures" which allow you to encapsulate and hide function arguments like so:
   ... restriction = SetMorphism(lambda x : eq1(x,alpha,beta,...))
   where alpha, beta are preloaded variables that should not be exposed to the restriction function

* We'll reconnect with Prof. Kraft once we have data in hand and constants all estimated
 - That way we can get a "blessing" that we're on the right path

Action items:
---

Coyle:
+ Write up the rederivation of Goodwin's model using time-varying alpha, beta, etc.
+ Finalize estimating parameters alpha, beta, sigma
+ Finalize getting timeseries data for u, v
+ Go talk to Dr. Kraft about estimating gamma, rho from the Phillips curve

Fantie:
+ Finalize encoding the Goodwin model
+ (Next) Data parser...
 . suggestion is to python pandas library
 . might need to use a python-based scraping library
 . Output of the parser will be packed into a Section object (see end of the unit test for pysheaf)

Williams:
+ Finalize estimating parameters alpha, beta, sigma
+ Finalize getting timeseries data for u, v
+ Go talk to Dr. Kraft about estimating gamma, rho from the Phillips curve

Kraft:
+ Help us figure out what we're doing wrong with the Phillips curve
+ We'll aim to reconnect soon, essentially after Coyle/Williams finish parameter estimation

Robinson:
+ Preparing for SIMPLEX PI meeting next week
+ AU consultant hiring is convoluted... Stand by
+ (Low priority) How to systematically do bifurcation analysis on a parametrized sheaf model of an ODE system
 - Essentially, what do global sections of a (pre)sheaf of smooth manifolds look like?  Is there an easy way to examine them using, say, transversality?
 - Of course, a sheaf of smooth manifolds would need gluing axioms satisfied, which might not work out! We might need stratified manifolds throughout... hmm...
