Note: 

Synopsis:
---

* Reformulated the Goodwin model so that it can support time-varying alpha, beta (time-varying sigma doesn't seem to impact the structure of the equations)

* Looks like the Phillips curve isn't working correctly
 - We can recover scatter plots for inflation versus employment rate and wage rate verus inflation.  Both plots match what others have done, so we're mostly confident of them.
 - The composition of the two, though, wage rate versus employment rate, seems to not yield a strong correlation!
 - Need to call in Dr. Kraft's help!

* PySheaf implementation of Goodwin models underway
 - The structure is correct and complete
 - The definition of the restriction maps needs a little help...  Should define LinearMorphism( NUMPY ARRAY ), though
 - A few more attributes for the cells need to be defined, but can be done easily
   . SheafCell.stalkDim = sum of lengths of the timeseries at that cell
   . SheafCell.compactClosure = True (unless told otherwise by Dr. Robinson)
   . SheafCell.metric = accept the default (Euclidean) but there is probably a more generally accepted metric that we ought to use...
 - We talked about "closures" which allow you to encapsulate and hide function arguments like so:
   ... restriction = SetMorphism(lambda x : eq1(x,alpha,beta,...))
   where alpha, beta are preloaded variables that should not be exposed to the restriction function

* We'll reconnect with Prof. Kraft once we have data in hand and constants all estimated
 - That way we can get a "blessing" that we're on the right path

Action items:
---

Coyle/Williams:
* Written up the rederivation of Goodwin's model using time-varying constants!
 + Circulate this to the rest of the team!
* Apparently the experimental data for the Goodwin model exhibits "epicycles" rather than cycles...
 + Find a reference or two where this is exhibited
 + Is there any indication of why this happens? (Specific assumptions, perhaps?)
+ Finalize estimating parameters alpha, beta, sigma
+ Finalize getting timeseries data for u, v
* Talked to Dr. Kraft about Philips curve
 - The problem appears to be that wage data extent doesn't go back far enough
  . Don't have wage data back beyond 1978ish
  . Have inflation data back further
  . Using St. Louis fed fit between wage and inflation to extrapolate (real) wages back to the extent of inflation data
  . Doing this extrapolation helps estimate a better Philips curve
 - Additionally there are essentially three epochs of Philips curve behavior
  . 1949-1966 (Dr. Kraft looked at our fit here and it's reasonable)
  . 1966-1983 (Dr. Kraft looked at our fit here and it's reasonable)
  . 1983-present (hasn't been shown to Dr. Kraft, but it's widely known to be flat)
  . Each requires a *separate* linear fit between employment and wage rate 

Fantie:
* Goodwin model coded up as a PySheaf module
+ Write some unit tests
 - Equilibrium should be a global section
 - Write a numerical (Euler!) solver for Goodwin equation
  . Feed this in to verify that the consistency radius for this is small
 - Consider using rough estimates of the constants
+ Write a data specification for the input data you'll need
 - Unit test this
 - Circulate it to the rest of the team
+ (Waiting on data finalization) Data parser...
 . suggestion is to python pandas library
 . might need to use a python-based scraping library
 . Output of the parser will be packed into a Section object (see end of the unit test for pysheaf)

Kraft:
+ Help us finalize the Phillips curve analysis
+ Talk about time-varying "constants"
+ We'll aim to reconnect soon, essentially after Coyle/Williams finish parameter estimation

Robinson:
* Survived the SIMPLEX PI meeting...
+ AU consultant hiring is convoluted... Stand by
+ (Low priority) How to systematically do bifurcation analysis on a parametrized sheaf model of an ODE system
 - Essentially, what do global sections of a (pre)sheaf of smooth manifolds look like?  Is there an easy way to examine them using, say, transversality?
 - Of course, a sheaf of smooth manifolds would need gluing axioms satisfied, which might not work out! We might need stratified manifolds throughout... hmm...
